# SSB-Demod
SSB demodulator on the RX chain of a SDR, built as part of ECE295 course at the University of Toronto

This project uses AutoMetrology Python library from [here](https://github.com/jdtech3/instrument-automation).
To make sure the submodule is also pulled by git, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` after cloning!
